# My To Do List

**Note:** All my tasks (who logged in to the system) are in this section. According to the program routine, each one that is defined must start that day and pulse at the end of office hours. If it is open individually, the system will display it in red as an alert.
Tasks can be started or pulsed or closed or rejected.
